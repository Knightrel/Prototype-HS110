# Prototype-HS110
A prototype for the HS110 with Engegy Monitor.

Requirements:

a.  Stand-alone bridge (PC, Raspberry) running node.js and version Prototype.js"  The attached is a separate copy for your convenience.

# Installation:

This Device Handler REQUIRES the 'Prototpye.js' bridge app.  It runs concurrently with existing bridge apps for this product line. It uses Port 8085 on the Bridge.

Installation is as for the original devices.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DELETE THE ORIGINAL DEVICE.  You can add this as a second rendition using a unique Device Network ID (I use HS100PROTO).  This allows existing functions to work w/o interference.

Instruction to tester:

a.  Use SmartThing Logging.  I need to have the log of a single refresh command (about four lines) to debug problems.

b.  Evaluate Interface - Is this the way to do Current Power - or do you want a separate Tile.

c.  If it works - tell me.

d.  Where next?  How much of the TP-Link Energy Monitor functions do you want?????
