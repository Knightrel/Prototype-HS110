# Prototype-HS110
A prototype for the HS110 with Engegy Monitor.

Requirements:

a.  Stand-alone bridge (PC, Raspberry) running node.js and version 2.1 of "TP-LinkServer.js"  The attached is a separate copy for your convenience.

Instruction to tester:

a.  Use SmartThing Logging.  I need to have the log of a single refresh command (about four lines) to debug problems.

b.  Evaluate Interface - Is this the way to do Current Power - or do you want a separate Tile.

c.  If it works - tell me.

d.  Where next?  How much of the TP-Link Energy Monitor functions do you want?????
